				<td>Tinikling</td>
				<td>Considered by many as the National Dance of the Philippines, Tinikling is inspired by the movement of the tikling birds. The dance involves at least two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance.

				<td>Cariñosa</td>
				<td>First introduced to the Philippines by the Spaniards in the 16th century, the name of this romantic dance means ‘loving one’ or ‘affectionate one’. Despite its Spanish heritage, the dance has very much adapted to the local culture. This dance was used for courtship.</td>

				<td>Sinulog</td>
				<td>The Sinulog is a ritual dance that's performed in honor of Santo Niño. It's now a part of the annual Sinulog festival, and dancers wear brightly colored, traditional costumes when performing. Unlike some of the other Filipino folk dances, this one requires drums. 
				The magnificence of the festival made Filipinos, as well as our fellow Asians, refer to it as the “Mother of all Festivals”.</td>

				<td>Dugso</td>
				<td>While the majority of the Philippines' cultural dances have been touched in some way by colonial influence, there are indigenous dances that are purely Filipino. In the communities where these dances are practiced, they're used as a form of worship, which makes them a sacred cultural act. Dugso is a stand-out among these indigenous dances, and it has been choreographed in multiple portions to please and entertain the various tribes' gods and deities.</td>
